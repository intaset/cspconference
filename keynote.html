  <p class="body">Johannes Kiefer is Chair Professor and Head of the division of engineering
thermodynamics at the University of Bremen, Germany. In addition, he is an
Honorary Professor at the University of Aberdeen, Scotland, and he holds a
guest professorship of the Erlangen Graduate School in Advanced Optical
Technologies (SAOT) at the University Erlangen-Nuremberg, Germany. </p>

 <p class="body">He earned
his chemical engineering degree and a PhD from the University
Erlangen-Nuremberg. From 2010 to 2014 he was a lecturer and senior lecturer
at the University of Aberdeen before he moved to Bremen. He was visiting
researcher at renowned institutions including the division of combustion
physics at the University of Lund, Sweden and the Combustion Research
Facility of the Sandia National Labs Livermore, US. His research interests
are the areas of developing and applying spectroscopic techniques for the
characterization of advanced materials and processes including combustion.
Johannes has received a number of prizes including the Combustion Institute
British Section's Hinshelwood Prize 2012 and the 2010 distinguished paper
award on diagnostics at the 33rd International Symposium on Combustion.</p>

  <p class="body">Xianfeng Fan is a chair professor and a deputy director of chemical engineering in School of Engineering at the University of Edinburgh. He was a Senior Lecturer at London South Bank University, and was a research fellow at the University of Birmingham. Professor Fan has been working on particulate materials processing, fluidization, CO2 capture and storage through developing a compact capture process using microwave and rotating packed bed, adsorbents and composite membranes, the development of visible light effective photocatalysis for biomass production, CO2 reforming and waste water treatment, multiphase flow in porous materials for enhanced oil recovery and fuel cells. Professor Fan has received about 4 million research grants from British Research Council, has collaborations with researcher/professors from 9 countries. He has been invited to give a number of plenary lectures, keynote lectures, invited talks at international conferences, proceedings, seminars, and to chair many sessions in international conferences. He has authored or co-authored over 180 peer reviewed publications and contributed 3 book chapters, and is editorial board members for 4 international journals. He has secured Â£3 million research funding in UK. </p>

 <p class="body">Before coming to UK, Prof Fan was a group leader and worked on materials separation and metallurgy at Beijing General Research Institute of Mining and Metallurgy, led several National projects, and were rewarded three times by Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China, and China Nonferrous Metals Industry Corporation. </p>
