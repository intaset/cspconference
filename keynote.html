  <p class="body">Oskar J. Haidn, born, January 27, 1995 holds a diploma degree in chemical engineering (1984) and a doctorate degree (1991) in fluid mechanics both from the University of Erlangen-Nürnberg. He joined the Institute of Space Propulsion of the German Aerospace Center (DLR) in 1990 and served there in several positions until he became head of the Technology Department in 1998 and Deputy Director Research and Technology in 1999. He was appointed Professor of Space Propulsion from the Technical University Munich in April 2011 which he joined in October 2011.</p>

  <p class="body">His research interests cover all fields of liquid propellant rocket engines such as injection, atomization, ignition, combustion, heat transfer and cyclic life analyses and in particular all types of dynamic processes. He holds several patents in the field and is author and coauthor of more than 250 conference papers, journal articles and book chapters.</p>

  <p class="body">Professor Sergei Sazhin has received his PhD in St Petersburg State University (Russia) during the period of 1972 – 1977. Currently, he is working as Professor of Thermal Physics in the University of Brighton. He is serving as an editorial member of several international refereed journals, an Associate Editor of Journal of Advances in Mechanical Engineering and Sciences (JAMES) (2015– present) and expert reviewer for numerous international journals and conferences. Chairman of the scientific committee of the 27th European Conference on Liquid Atomization and Spray Systems, University of Brighton, Brighton, UK (2016). Member of the World Congress on Engineering (WCE) program committee (since 2008). Member of the program committees of numerous international conferences. He has authored of more than 490 publications, including 3 monographs and 222 papers in international refereed journals. His current ISI Web of Science citation index is 28.  He has supervised 14 successful PhD completions over the past 15 years. He is a Fellow of the Institute of Physics (UK) since 1994. His current research is focused on numerical and asymptotic modelling of fluid dynamics, heat/mass transfer, and combustion processes in Diesel and gasoline sprays.</p>
