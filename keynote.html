  <p class="body">Oskar J. Haidn, born, January 27, 1995 holds a diploma degree in chemical engineering (1984) and a doctorate degree (1991) in fluid mechanics both from the University of Erlangen-NÃ¼rnberg. He joined the Institute of Space Propulsion of the German Aerospace Center (DLR) in 1990 and served there in several positions until he became head of the Technology Department in 1998 and Deputy Director Research and Technology in 1999. He was appointed Professor of Space Propulsion from the Technical University Munich in April 2011 which he joined in October 2011.</p>

  <p class="body">His research interests cover all fields of liquid propellant rocket engines such as injection, atomization, ignition, combustion, heat transfer and cyclic life analyses and in particular all types of dynamic processes. He holds several patents in the field and is author and coauthor of more than 250 conference papers, journal articles and book chapters.</p>
