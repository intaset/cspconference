  <p class="body">Dr. Pedro Coelho graduated in Mechanical Engineering in 1984 and received his Ph.D. in 1992 at Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico (IST), University of Lisbon, Portugal. He is professor at the Department of Mechanical Engineering of IST, being responsible for the group of disciplines of Transport Phenomena. He has been vice-President of the Mechanical Engineering Department since 2009. He has about 80 papers published in international journals, and 100 papers presented at international conferences. He is co-author of a book on Combustion (in Portuguese) for undergraduate and master students. His research is in the field of numerical simulation of heat transfer and combustion problems. Specific areas of interest are radiation models, gas radiative properties, turbulence-radiation interaction, turbulent diffusion flames, mild combustion and industrial combustion equipment. He is reviewer of about 50 international journals. He is member of the Eurotherm Committee for the Advancement of Thermal Sciences and Heat Transfer, member of the Scientific Council, Assembly and Executive Committee of the International Centre of Heat and Mass Transfer, member of the Assembly for International Heat Transfer Conferences and member of the Assembly of the World Conference (AWC) on Experimental Heat Transfer, Fluid Mechanics, and Thermodynamics. He is member of the Editorial Board of several journals, and associate editor of the J. Quantitative Spectroscopy and Radiative Transfer.</p>
