  <p class="body">Dr. Motevalli is a Professor of Mechanical Engineering and Associate Dean of Engineering for Research and Innovation at Tennessee Tech (TN Tech) since August of 2013.  He also serves as the Interim Director of the Center of Excellence for Manufacturing Research since August 2014.  He is responsible for the growth of externally funded research, oversight of College of Engineering (CoE) research centers, oversight of the college graduate program, director of the PhD program, faculty recruitment and development, innovation and entrepreneurship initiatives, undergraduate research, and international engagement.  He devotes substantial time and effort on external relations for the college.  These interactions include government agencies such as the Office of Science and Technology, NSF, DARPA, DoE, FAA and others as needed.  Dr. Motevalli has been conducting interdisciplinary research and education throughout his career. </p>
<p class="body">Dr. Motevalli came to TN Tech from Purdue University, where he served as the Founding Director of Center for Technology Development (CTD), project director and faculty advisor for the Purdue EcoCar2,  and prior to that the Head of Mechanical Engineering Technology Department. Dr. Motevalli has more than 30 years of teaching, research and administrative experience in academia, government and industry with diverse research expertise in combustion, fire safety, hybrid-electric vehicles, aviation safety and security and transportation safety. These diverse research activities, thus far, have been supported by more than $15 million in external funding.  He has over 100 technical publications in addition to reports, presentations and invited talks and has directed over 35 graduate students. His professional experience outside academia includes working at national and government laboratories (NIST, NRL), government (US Congress as ASME Congressional Fellow) and consulting. </p>
<p class="body">Before moving to Purdue, he was at the George Washington University (GW) in a variety of positions including Director of the Aviation Institute from 2004-2008, co-Director of the Institute (2002-04), Director of the Aviation Safety and Security Certificate Program (1998-2008), and Associate Professor of Engineering from 2004-2009.  He was also selected as a Senior Homeland Security Fellow of the GW Homeland Security Policy Institute for the 2009 calendar year.  While at GW, he directed the International Aviation Safety and Security Summit program (2001-2005). This was a leadership program for ministers and Directors General of civil aviation of more than 100 countries throughout the world.  This program was accomplished with a $9 million funding from the FAA, and was supported by the DOT Secretary’s office.  Dr. Motevalli also worked closely with the Gore Commission staff (President’s Commission on Aviation Safety and Security in 21st Century) in 1996-97.
